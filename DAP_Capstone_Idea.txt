DAP Capstone Idea
==================

Working on an idea to track language migration in the US, comparing data from last and most recent US Census data.

This to answer the questions ...
"How should businesses be positioning themselves to maximize engagement with the new and changing sociolinguistic demographic in the US marketplace"

- Trying to figure out how to pull that data down from US Census Bureau
- Looking to break down the language distribution by region
- Plot out the socioeconomic strata/divisions in every language group
- Looking at how that distribution has changed from census to census
- Looking at how to augment that data from additional sources
- Looking how to present that data graphically using maps and charts

Not sure how much I'm gonna get done as my participation is currently limited.
